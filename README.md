<p2> Capullo's first comic work was a publication called Gore Shriek, which was picked up and published by a comic book store in Albany, New York, called Fantaco Enterprises. Gore Shriek was a horror comic book specifically labeled Not Intended for Children because of the violent and graphic nature of it.

Due to the success of the small comic series, when it had ended, Capullo began work for Marvel Comics where he worked on Quasar, X-Force, and What If?. He worked with Marvel Comics for three years on various works, before moving on to other publications and projects with different companies.

Briefly after Capullo had started work with Marvel, he had begun smaller independent projects away from the company. He had started involvement with separate labels and anyone who would hire him for miscellaneous odd-jobs that needed completion.[citation needed]

Todd McFarlane, who had left Marvel Comics to co-found Image Comics, noticed Capullo’s work on X-Force, and convinced him become the penciller on McFarlane’s comic, Spawn. Capullo's first issue of the book was #16, then took over as pencil artist with issue #26. Capullo has since done the cover art and pencils for many Image publications, including various Spawn tie-ins and variants, and Capullo’s own miniseries, The Creech. Capullo helped McFarlane in creating the artwork now seen on the two Halo 3-themed controllers.

In February 2007, Image Comics published The Art of Greg Capullo, a hardcover book showcasing Capullo’s artwork, ranging from widely recognized cover art to unknown never released pencils, early submissions samples and personal sketches.
